# This file contains the package requirements for the project.
# It is recommended to install these in a dedicated conda environment.
#
# To create and activate the environment, run the following commands:
# conda create --name gnn_defense python=3.9
# conda activate gnn_defense
#
# Then, install the packages using conda:
# conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
# conda install pyg -c pyg

# If you have a different version of CUDA, please modify the pytorch-cuda version accordingly.
# You can find the correct command on the PyTorch website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

# For non-conda users, you can try installing with pip, but conda is recommended for better compatibility.
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# pip install torch-geometric
